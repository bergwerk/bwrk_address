## What it does

You are completely free in how many informations you store for one contact and which types of information this is.

By default bwrk_address comes with the following entry-types:

* image
* phone
* fax
* mail
* website
* company
* country
* city
* zip
* street_address
* note
* media_gallery
* downloads

The differences between these types are the possible field values:
 
* fal images
* fal files
* rte
* textfield

In addition every type has it's own template partial, so you are able to render each behaviour separately. 
e.q. render a slider in element media_gallery
